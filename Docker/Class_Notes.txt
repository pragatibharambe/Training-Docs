	Containerization using Docker::::

		Application deployments :::

			Deployment ?		===> *.war

			build server -- created artifacts ==> tested using tomcat ==> helloworld.war --> 
						jdk1.8, tomcatserver 8.5 ==> helloworld.war

					package --> (helloworld.war,jdk1.8,tomcatserver 8.5) - app_pkg_v1.0 -- Images

			deploy to target
				QA		jdk1.6, tomcatserver 10		app_pkg_v1.0 (helloworld.war,jdk1.8,tomcatserver 8.5) 
				UAT		jdk1.8, tomcatserver 8.5
				PROD		openjdk11, tomcatserver 9


	In general, 
	Containers --> 

		- Deployment
			package --> (helloworld.war,jdk1.8,tomcatserver 8.5) - app_pkg_v1.0

		- Infra-structure Containers are used at infra level :::

		(VMs)Jenkins_Master :
			(VMs) Slave1 ==> Java build 
			(VMs) Slave2 ==> python 
			(VMs) Slave3 ==> .Net 			..... 100 

			Using Containers :::
	
		(VMs)Jenkins_Master :
			(VMs)Jenkins_Slave
				Install Docker Engine	
					Container1	 ==> Java build	
					Container2	 ==> python 
					Container3	 ==> .Net
		
	What is VM (vs) Container ? 
	The Container Images will be stored and maintained in Container Registry!
	Dockerhub is one of the container registries.

	Virtual Machine :::



	VM : 	Are Harware level Virtualization 
		Used to run OS and applications
		It takes huge time to load and utilize the underlying hardware config.

	Containers :	Are OS level Virtualizations - Namespaces/CG/Kernal
			Containers are used to run the applications NOT Operating systems.
			It is faster when compared to VMs.
			If there is not task/appln. to execute, containers will immediately go to EXIT State.


	Virtual Machines :::
		EC2 Instances ::: VM 


	Regions 
		Availability Zones/Data-centers
		Servers


	Docker Terminologies :::

		Docker Images ::	Package --> (Application artifacts along with its dependencies)
					Images are not executables.

		Docker Containers ::	Containers are executables.
					Containers are used to run the images.
					We cannot directly create containers. Docker Containers are created/executed only using docker images.
		
		Docker Registry ::	A platform to store all the docker images.
					Docker Hub is the default docker registry.
					Create the repository in the docker registry and store the images.
					It contains many images - always it is recommended to choose the official verified images.



	Installation of Docker Engine :::				


	CICD Deployment Workflow using Docker :

	Developers:
		Use Eclipse / VS Code and create the application
		Push the application into github repo.
	DevOps :	
		Using Jenkins CI/CD Pipline: (Build Orchestration Tool)

			SCM Checkout :
				- Checkout the latest code from github :
			
			Application Build : 
				- Compile and create artifacts

			Docker image Build :
				- Build the docker image --> (Create docker application image along with its dependencies)
			
			Publish Image :
				- Pubish / push the docker images to docker registry(dockerhub)
			
			Deploy using Kubernetes : (Kubernetes is called as Container Orchestration Tool)
				- Pull the image from docker hub registry
				- Deploy that image in the deployment servers --> QA/UAT/PROD


	Installation of Docker Engine ::: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

	Docker for windows: 

		VM - Linux - Install Docker Engine

	Linux ;--> Directly install Docker engine.

	VMs..... 


	tomcat ::: ==> install in a VM - qa-testing 


	Using Container we can run tomcat. ::
		
	tomcat -- pull/run ==> 

vm --> tomcat container 8080 -->

	Container Volumes ::
		
		Life time of container?
			
		Application Image :
		Deployed :

		
			Stateful Application
			Stateless Application

		Container1 --> webappln ==> create a log_file

		Host Volume will be Mapped with the Container volume 


	Micro_service Based Application :: ==> spring boot appln. 
	
		- will have its own scm repo., test cases, test scenarios, test approval, depolyments, dabase.... and image.

	Run_My_appliation	==> 3-tier application ::

		front-end		container1
		backend			container2
		business logic		container3

	Docker Compose 	::: - is used to run multiple containers.
	Docker Swarm 	:::	Is a container orchestration tool, which helps to orchestrate the container execution and ensure high availability of containers.

	Kubernetes ::: 		Is a container Orchestration Tool.



			
	- How to build application Images using docker ?
		
		build application & Create artifacts 
			mvn-hello-world.war 

		build application Image out of this.	
	
		publish this application image to docker hub(Docker registry)

		pull and execute(Kubernetes)


	Docker pull / run ==> it is used to download/run the existing images from docker registry.

	To Create Docker Image :

		docker commit command 		
			Used upate the image with more layers. 
			Eg.: Centos Image
				docker run -it centos bash
				
				exit 
				centos_s1 ==> image


		Create a container Image using Docker Commit :::


		docker build command
			Need a Dockerfile



		Publish the docker image to docker hub(Docker registry)

			first we shd have docker hub access token.
		


Task on Jenkins ::

	CI/CD --> 
		1. CI/CD -- Trigger should be automatic. using poll scm & github webhook.
		2. Jenkins Job --> To clean the Workspace.(I should have only last 2 days Workspace details).
		3. Clean up workspace as soon as the artifacts is deployed to target server.

	pull and execute(Kubernetes)

	Kubernetes ::::

		Intro. to K8s 
		Architecture of Kubernetes!

Next Installation of Kubernetes :::
Working with Pods
Working with Deployments Controllers
