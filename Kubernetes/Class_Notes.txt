	Kubernetes Architecture :
	Installation of Kubernetes


	for next 3 days.
	
	CI/CD Pipeline ::::

	pipeline --> jenkins_master, Slave, Docker build, kubernetes
		

	SCM Repo. github 

		Continuous Development ::::
			Eclipse based IDE to develope the code
			MAVEN Web Application
			Spring Boot Framework
			Using Python
			Commit the changes to github repo
		
		CI/CD --> SCM_Checkout, build artifacts, build docker image, deploy to kubernetes cluster

		Contiuous Testing ::::


	
	Kubernetes ::
		Master  ==> Just used to validate and schedule the pods to worker nodes.
			Cluster :
				Kubernetes Worker Node1
				Kubernetes Worker Node2
				Kubernetes Worker Node3
				Kubernetes Worker Node4

	Installation of Kubernetes :::

		Kubernetes is a open source container orchestration Tool..
			kubeadm 	==> install & config 
			minikube 	==> light weight K8s Cluster. (Learning)


	used kubeadm ::

		Pre-requisites ::

			2+ CPUs
			3 GB of RAM

	Managed Services ::	
		AWS - EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Services
		Azure - AKS
		GCP - GKS

	Pods :::
		Atomic unit of task 

	Kubectl
		Command Line Utility :
		Used to interact with Kubernetes Master
		kubectl 
	Namespaces
	Pods Networking
	Pods Volumes
	Services

	Controllers



		kubectl get nodes


	Pods ===> Pod IP will be generated.


	





	pod ID : 192.168.0.1						pod ID : 192.168.0.2
	Container port : 8080						Nginx : 80
		192.168.0.1:8080						192.168.0.2:80
	




				8080				80


											pod ID : 192.168.0.4
					localhost:8080 & localhost:80


		
	Kubernetes Services :::
		
		Cluster_IP
		NodePort	nodeport range == 30000 -- 
		Load_Balancer
		
															----> frontend pod

	3-tier
		Front_End 	- UI	
		Back_End	- Database
		Business Logics												----> Backend pod





	Create a Pod :::

		Manifest file :::
